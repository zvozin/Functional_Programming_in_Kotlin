# Functional Programming in Kotlin

This is a repository of exercises from @pchuisano and @runorama's imminent book ["Function Programming in Scala"](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala), implemented [koan-style](https://sinairv.wordpress.com/2012/05/27/programming-koans-one-of-the-best-ways-to-learn-a-new-language-or-framework) in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org).

Kotlin is a remarkably mature up-to-date Java replacement designed by [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) - the IntelliJ guys. It's strictly typed with generics, a lambda syntax, lithe collections with syntactic sugars, infix syntax, operator overloading, and a [first-class extension facility](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html) (albeit with no definite plans to support type classes/structural types the way, say, Swift does - [not yet, anyway](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/type-classes-in-kotlin/410)). 

If you are a recovering Scala coder like me, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Get [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea), work through [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html), then try these, in that order. Going in order of exercices, read the instructions (copied verbatim from the book), then write the  code to get tests to pass. 

Try not to peek at the solutions until you're truly stumped. I would highly recommend getting the book and following it along as you go.

## Notes

- The Kotlin versions of the exercises typically define extension functions where the Scala originals use standalones. This is my personal preference of what I felt to be more idiomatic for a rightward-growing, OO-heritaged language
- Consider *NOT* using what you implement here in production code
